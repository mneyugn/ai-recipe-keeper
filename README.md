## Project Description

AI RecipeKeeper is designed to streamline the process of digitizing and organizing culinary recipes. The application leverages LLMs to automatically extract and structure recipe data from text inputs and supported cooking websites, significantly reducing the time users spend manually transcribing recipes.

### Key Features

- **AI-Powered Recipe Parsing**: Automatically extract recipe structure (ingredients, steps, tags, timing) from pasted text
- **URL Import Support**: Import recipes directly from aniagotuje.pl and kwestiasmaku.com
- **Recipe Management**: Full CRUD operations for personal recipe collection
- **User Authentication**: Secure account system with password recovery
- **Private Collections**: All recipes are private and accessible only to the recipe owner
- **Quality Feedback**: Rate AI parsing quality to help improve the system

### Supported Sources

- Manual text input (up to 10,000 characters)
- aniagotuje.pl
- kwestiasmaku.com

## Tech Stack

### Frontend

- **Astro 5**
- **React 19**
- **TypeScript 5**
- **Tailwind CSS 4**
- **Shadcn/ui**

### Backend

- **Supabase**
- **Openrouter.ai**

### Development & Deployment

- **Node.js 22.14.0**
- **GitHub Actions**
- **DigitalOcean**

### Testing

- **Vitest** (Unit Tests)
- **Playwright** (E2E Tests)

## Getting Started Locally

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22.14.0 (use .nvmrc for version management)
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mneyugn/ai-recipe-keeper.git
   cd ai-recipe-keeper
   ```

2. **Use the correct Node.js version**

   ```bash
   nvm use
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Environment Setup**

   Copy the example environment file and configure your variables:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Configure the following environment variables:

   - Supabase configuration (URL, API keys)
   - Openrouter.ai API key
   - Other application-specific settings

5. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:4321`
